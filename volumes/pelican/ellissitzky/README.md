This theme is based on [voce](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce), a responsive theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). It was templated on [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/gfidente/pelican-svbhack) by [Giulio Fidente](https://github.com/giulivo). It is inspired by the work of El Lissitzky and tries to be as minimalistic as possible.
